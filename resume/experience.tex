    {CTO, Developer} % Job title
    {Eres Biotech} % Organization
    {Ankara, Turkiye} % Location
    {Sep. 2016 - Jan. 2019} % Date(s)
    {        As Technical Lead at Eres, a science-focused company established in 2013, I drive initiatives at the intersection of biological research and science education, including the development of educational kits and digital platforms. One flagship project is Bilimkutusu.com, an e-commerce platform built on Sylius (Symfony PHP framework), where I oversaw end-to-end development. This involved architecting a modern frontend with Webpack, Sass, and vanilla JavaScript, engineering PostgreSQL databases to manage intricate product and inventory logic, and creating custom Sylius plugins to enhance platform capabilities. The solution prioritized scalability and flexibility to accommodate evolving scientific product lines.
      Another key initiative, Bilimma.com, a science news portal, evolved through strategic technical iterations. Initially launched on WordPress, I modernized its frontend with a Next.js rebuild to boost performance and user experience. Recognizing the need for editorial efficiency, I later migrated the platform to Webflow, reducing technical overhead while maintaining dynamic content workflows. This transition exemplified a pragmatic approach to balancing innovation with operational sustainability.
  My work at Eres emphasizes adaptable, context-driven solutions. From evaluating CMS options to executing full platform migrations, I focus on aligning technical rigor with organizational goals. The Bilimma.com progression—from prototyping modern frameworks to adopting no-code tools—highlights this philosophy, ensuring solutions remain maintainable and aligned with team capabilities. By prioritizing phased modernization and cross-functional collaboration, I bridge complex technical requirements with the practical needs of scientific communication and education.
